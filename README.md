# Berlin Airbnb Price Prediction – Gradient Boosted Trees

## Overview

This project builds a **machine-learning model to predict Airbnb listing prices in Berlin** using a cleaned dataset of listing attributes.
The goal is to explore the factors influencing rental prices and build a strong predictive model using **CatBoost Gradient Boosted Trees**.

This repository is part of my data science & machine learning portfolio.

## Key Features

* End-to-end workflow in a single, clean Jupyter Notebook
* Feature engineering of text, categorical, and numerical fields
* Distribution analysis for price and log-price
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas & matplotlib
* Model training using **CatBoostRegressor**
* Model evaluation (RMSE, MAE)
* Final model saved via pickle for reproducibility
* Discussion of features such as amenities, host verification, neighbourhood, and property characteristics

## Modeling Approach

### **Model:**

* **CatBoost Gradient Boosted Trees**
* Chosen due to:
  ✔️ Native handling of categorical features
  ✔️ Strong performance on tabular data
  ✔️ Minimal preprocessing compared to XGBoost/LightGBM

### **Target Variable:**

* `price`
* Log-transformed for modeling: `log_price`

### **Important Steps:**

* Outlier handling
* Encoding categorical variables
* Feature scaling where needed
* Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, depth, iterations)
* Train–test split and cross-validation

---

## Results

* The model achieves strong predictive performance on unseen test data
* Log-transform significantly stabilizes variance and improves fit
* High-impact features include:

  * Neighborhood
  * Room type
  * Number of accommodates and bathrooms
  * Host verification
  * Amenities (limited effect after one-hot expansion)

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* NumPy
